# R-scripts
All R scripts used in Prenni Lab publications
Scripts found in the Seitz_2022 branch were used in the publication "Variation in Root Exudate Composition Influences Soil Microbiome Membership and Function".

commands_for_merged_data.txt are all commands used in the QIIME2 workflow for processing 16S rRNA data. 

Met1_met2_new_analysis_10-30-2020.R are all commands used in the GC-MS analysis of the exometabolites. exported spectral data was then exported as .MSP file and imported into RAMSearch for cluster identification. 

ASV_diversity_analysis_for microcosms.R was used for alpha and beta diversity metrics, as seen in figure 2A and NMDS_for_merged_16S_data.R for figure 2B. 

heatmap.R and ridgeplots_met1_just_metabolites.R were used in figure 3

rank_abundace_by_treatment.R used in figure 5E

change in exudates conc boxplots.R used to determine how exometabolite dynamics changed during exudate addition phase.
